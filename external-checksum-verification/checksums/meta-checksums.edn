;; Meta-checksums for incremental checksum files
;; This file stores checksums of the incremental-checksums-*.txt.gz files
;; from the Clojars repository to detect tampering.
;;
;; Format: EDN list of maps with the following keys:
;;   :file      - Filename (e.g., "incremental-checksums-1.txt.gz")
;;   :number    - Sequential number extracted from filename
;;   :sha256    - SHA-256 checksum of the file
;;   :md5       - MD5 checksum of the file
;;   :size      - File size in bytes
;;   :timestamp - ISO 8601 timestamp when this entry was added
;;
;; SECURITY NOTES:
;; - This file is stored in git to provide an audit trail
;; - Never force-push or rewrite history - this would destroy the audit trail
;; - Any modification to historical entries indicates a security breach
;; - New entries should only be added, never removed or modified
;;
;; Example entry:
;; {:file "incremental-checksums-1.txt.gz"
;;  :number 1
;;  :sha256 "a1b2c3d4e5f6..."
;;  :md5 "1a2b3c4d..."
;;  :size 123456
;;  :timestamp "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"}
